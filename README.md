# entity end-date data

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://github.com/digital-land/XXX/blob/main/LICENSE)

This repo holds scripts used to calculate end-dates for entities on [planning.data.gov.uk](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk), as well as csv files which are used as endpoints to add facts to existing entities.

Currently this is a test with the `brownfield-land` collection, but may be extended to others.
